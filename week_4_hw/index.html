    <h1><header> My Thoughts on Clubber Toy <header/></h1>
    
       <p>  Clubber Toy is an online Chrome Experiment with code that demonstrates the power of animations and intereacting with the viewer. Almost like a video game it simulates these never ending animations that are almost hallucinating and calming.The opening animation looks like this...............</p>

    <p>The animation has you intereact with it by keying in number 0-9 each number has its owned animation that plays on loop. You can quickly hit keys at the same time to transtion one animation into another and watch it fade infront of you. Now what makes this Chrome experiment great is that it opens up automatically to default techno club music linked to soundcloud. At the top there is a menu that allows you to view in full screen to view the animation as a whole in fullscreen and also to change the track. Changing the track happens by the webpage asking for a soundcloud URL to a track making the site customizable to the user to appear more. </p>

    <li>  Bright </li>
     <li> Colorful </li>
     <li> Theraputic </li>
     
 </ul>     

<p>When I interacted ont eh website the animation made me think of rave and club visuals so I played some trance over it as I explored I feel like the customization is the reason this webpage is so sucessful in interaction. The music is appealing to the viewer since they ahve the power to choose any track off of soundcloud. Here's a link below to the kind of genre I set the naimations to.</p>
